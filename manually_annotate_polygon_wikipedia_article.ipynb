    "Suppose the LLM read a chunk of Wikipedia text and returned a set of pairs for this chunk that is similar to my annotations above.\n",
    "How do we compare the LLM's answer to the fuzzy ground truth?\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's an outline of the algorithm plus some ideas for the future:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. validate both sets of pairs for duplicates and other trivially detectable inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "2. convert everything to lowercase and strip of spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "3. find exact matches, count them and exclude them from the sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the \"recall\" metric, i.e. the fraction of the ground truth samples that are covered by the LLM answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate the \"trash rate\" metric, i.e. $\\frac{n-C}{n}$ where we have $n$ pairs from the LLM and $C$ of them match some pairs from the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How can we aggregate the results when we've calculated the metrics for each of the N chunks? We can simply concatenate the lists of pairs for them and calculate recall and trash rate for the whole article.\n",
    "We can also keep the metrics for each chunk and average them, perhaps weighted by the number of ground truth pairs in each chunk.\n",
    "It's useful to check which chunks were least successful, what the typical problems were.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. MAYBE LATER: find partial matches by pairing $(l_i, L_i)$ with $(t_j, T_j)$ if $d(l_i, t_j) < D$ and $d(l_i, t_j) < D$ for some distance $d$ and threshold $D$ (e.g. edit distance of 2). This might account for slight variations such as apostrophe or spelling mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. MAYBE LATER: go over unmatched LLM answers and check for skipped elements in the hypernym chain, i.e. (rhombus, polygon) is a partially correct answer if the ground truth contains both (rhombus, quadrilateral) and (quadrilateral, polygon) \n",
    "\n",
    "9. MAYBE LATER: For each wrong answer (not a match), find a closest unpaired ground truth answer. That might ease debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. MAYBE LATER: use LLM as a judge.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. MAYBE LATER: support annotations with a list of equivalent acceptable pairs (e.g. acceptable spelling variations)\n",
    "\n",
    "12. MAYBE LATER: support annotations with possible but undesirable answers to catch wrong answers\n",
    "\n",
    "13. MAYBE LATER: add confidence scores for each ground truth pair, i.e. how important is it for the LLM to retrieve this pair. "

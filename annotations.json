This is because any simple n-gon ( having n sides ) can be considered to be made up of (n \u2212 2) triangles, each of which has an angle sum of \u03c0 radians or 180 degrees.

Tracing around a convex n-gon, the angle \"turned\" at a corner is the exterior or external angle. Tracing all the way around the polygon makes one full turn, so the sum of the exterior angles must be 360\u00b0. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an n-gon in general, the sum of the exterior angles (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple d of 360\u00b0, e.g. 720\u00b0 for a pentagram and 0\u00b0 for an angular \"eight\" or antiparallelogram, where d is the density or turning number of the polygon.  \n=== Area ===\nIn this section, the vertices of the polygon under consideration are taken to be  \n(  \nx  \n0  \n,  \ny  \n0  \n)\n,\n(  \nx  \n1  \n,  \ny  \n1  \n)\n,", "x_is_a_y": [["interior angle", "angle"], ["exterior angle", "angle"], ["external polygon", "polygon"], ["external polygon", "polygon"], ["simple n-gon", "n-gon"], ["convex n-gon", "n-gon"], ["concave simple polygon", "polygon"]]}, {"chunk": "=== Area ===\nIn this section, the vertices of the polygon under consideration are taken to be  \n(  \nx  \n0  \n,  \ny  \n0  \n)\n,\n(  \nx  \n1  \n,  \ny  \n1  \n)\n,\n\u2026\n,\n(  \nx  \nn\n\u2212\n1  \n,  \ny  \nn\n\u2212\n1  \n)  \n{\\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0}),(x_{1},y_{1}),\\ldots ,(x_{n-1},y_{n-1})}\nin order.

0|"In Euclidean geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.
Angles formed by two rays are also known as plane angles as they lie in the plane that contains the rays. Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes; these are called dihedral angles. Two intersecting curves may also define an angle, which is the angle of the rays lying tangent to the respective curves at their point of intersection.
The magnitude of an angle is called an angular measure or simply ""angle"". Angle of rotation is a measure conventionally defined as the ratio of a circular arc length to its radius, and may be a negative number. In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation."|4bd49cb1c18ede1eb214179e2fba9ff6|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
1|"The word angle comes from the Latin word angulus, meaning ""corner"". Cognate words include the Greek ἀγκύλος (ankylοs) meaning ""crooked, curved"" and the English word ""ankle"". Both are connected with the Proto-Indo-European root *ank-, meaning ""to bend"" or ""bow"".Euclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines that meet each other and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to the Neoplatonic metaphysician Proclus, an angle must be either a quality, a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept, angle as quality, was used by Eudemus of Rhodes, who regarded an angle as a deviation from a straight line; the second, angle as quality, by Carpus of Antioch, who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third: angle as a relationship."|ee8178f9c017e2971adf1acaca3c93fc|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
2|"In mathematical expressions, it is common to use Greek letters (α, β, γ, θ, φ, . . . ) as variables denoting the size of some angle (the symbol π is typically not used for this purpose to avoid confusion with the constant denoted by that symbol). Lower case Roman letters (a, b, c, . . . ) are also used. In contexts where this is not confusing, an angle may be denoted by the upper case Roman letter denoting its vertex. See the figures in this article for examples.
The three defining points may also identify angles in geometric figures. For example, the angle with vertex A formed by the rays AB and AC (that is, the half-lines from point A through points B and C) is denoted ∠BAC or  
B
A
C  
^  
{\displaystyle {\widehat {\rm {BAC}}}}
. Where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may sometimes be referred to by a single vertex alone (in this case, ""angle A"").
Potentially, an angle denoted as, say, ∠BAC might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C about A, the anticlockwise angle from B to C about A, the clockwise angle from C to B about A, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B about A, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see § Signed angles). However, in many geometrical situations, it is evident from the context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant, and in these cases, no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, to avoid ambiguity, specific conventions may be adopted so that, for instance, ∠BAC always refers to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from B to C about A and ∠CAB the anticlockwise (positive) angle from C to B about A."|73e1a3077ce0d8066c52c63b25854f64|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
3|"=== Individual angles ===
There is some common terminology for angles, whose measure is always non-negative (see § Signed angles):  
An angle equal to 0° or not turned is called a zero angle.
An angle smaller than a right angle (less than 90°) is called an acute angle (""acute"" meaning ""sharp"").
An angle equal to 1/4 turn (90° or π/2 radians) is called a right angle. Two lines that form a right angle are said to be normal, orthogonal, or perpendicular.
An angle larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle (between 90° and 180°) is called an obtuse angle (""obtuse"" meaning ""blunt"").
An angle equal to 1/2 turn (180° or π radians) is called a straight angle.
An angle larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn (between 180° and 360°) is called a reflex angle.
An angle equal to 1 turn (360° or 2π radians) is called a full angle, complete angle, round angle or perigon.
An angle that is not a multiple of a right angle is called an oblique angle.The names, intervals, and measuring units are shown in the table below:  
=== Vertical and adjacent angle pairs ===  
When two straight lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. Pairwise, these angles are named according to their location relative to each other.  
A transversal is a line that intersects a pair of (often parallel) lines and is associated with alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, interior angles, and exterior angles.  
=== Combining angle pairs ===
The angle addition postulate states that if B is in the interior of angle AOC, then  
I.e., the measure of the angle AOC is the sum of the measure of angle AOB and the measure of angle BOC.
Three special angle pairs involve the summation of angles:

Three special angle pairs involve the summation of angles:  
=== Polygon-related angles ===
An angle that is part of a simple polygon is called an interior angle if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A simple concave polygon has at least one interior angle, that is, a reflex angle.   In Euclidean geometry, the measures of the interior angles of a triangle add up to π radians, 180°, or 1/2 turn; the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex quadrilateral add up to 2π radians, 360°, or 1 turn. In general, the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex polygon with n sides add up to (n − 2)π  radians, or (n − 2)180 degrees, (n − 2)2 right angles, or (n − 2)1/2 turn.
The supplement of an interior angle is called an exterior angle; that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a linear pair of angles. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending one of the two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one must make at a vertex to trace the polygon. If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered negative. Even in a non-simple polygon, it may be possible to define the exterior angle. Still, one will have to pick an orientation of the plane (or surface) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.   In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple convex polygon, if only one of the two exterior angles is assumed at each vertex, will be one full turn (360°). The exterior angle here could be called a supplementary exterior angle. Exterior angles are commonly used in Logo Turtle programs when drawing regular polygons."|d4e50e358ac09cc626f2161ea78a58ee|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
5|"In a triangle, the bisectors of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are concurrent (meet at a single point).: 149
In a triangle, three intersection points, each of an external angle bisector with the opposite extended side, are collinear.: p. 149
In a triangle, three intersection points, two between an interior angle bisector and the opposite side, and the third between the other exterior angle bisector and the opposite side extended are collinear.: 149
Some authors use the name exterior angle of a simple polygon to mean the explement exterior angle (not supplement!) of the interior angle. This conflicts with the above usage.  
=== Plane-related angles ===
The angle between two planes (such as two adjacent faces of a polyhedron) is called a dihedral angle. It may be defined as the acute angle between two lines normal to the planes.
The angle between a plane and an intersecting straight line is equal to ninety degrees minus the angle between the intersecting line and the line that goes through the point of intersection and is normal to the plane."|546cdce4be716c8d190401e145269d59|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
6|"The size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles of the same size are said to be equal congruent or equal in measure.
In some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the orientation of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full turn are effectively equivalent.  In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a spiral curve or describing an object's cumulative rotation in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.  
To measure an angle θ, a circular arc centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g., with a pair of compasses. The ratio of the length s of the arc by the radius r of the circle is the number of radians in the angle:
Conventionally, in mathematics and the SI, the radian is treated as being equal to the dimensionless unit 1, thus being normally omitted.
The angle expressed by another angular unit may then be obtained by multiplying the angle by a suitable conversion constant of the form k/2π, where k is the measure of a complete turn expressed in the chosen unit (for example, k = 360° for degrees or 400  grad for gradians):  
The value of θ thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed, then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio s/r is unaltered.  
=== Units ==="|7c34886bd82e4074f27bc9c5c960e1ae|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
7|"=== Units ===
Throughout history, angles have been measured in various units. These are known as angular units, with the most contemporary units being the degree ( ° ), the radian (rad), and the gradian (grad), though many others have been used throughout history. Most units of angular measurement are defined such that one turn (i.e., the angle subtended by the circumference of a circle at its centre) is equal to n units, for some whole number n.  Two exceptions are the radian (and its decimal submultiples) and the diameter part.
In the International System of Quantities, an angle is defined as a dimensionless quantity, and in particular, the radian unit is dimensionless. This convention impacts how angles are treated in dimensional analysis.
The following table list some units used to represent angles.  
=== Dimensional analysis ===  
=== Signed angles ===  
It is frequently helpful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and/or rotations in opposite directions or ""sense"" relative to some reference.
In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The initial side is on the positive x-axis, while the other side or terminal side is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns, with positive angles representing rotations toward the positive y-axis and negative angles representing rotations toward the negative y-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by standard position, defined by the x-axis rightward and the y-axis upward, positive rotations are anticlockwise, and negative cycles are clockwise."|894e56eea3c32583b611bd787efa6739|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
8|"In many contexts, an angle of −θ is effectively equivalent to an angle of ""one full turn minus θ"". For example, an orientation represented as −45° is effectively equal to an orientation defined as 360° − 45° or 315°.  Although the final position is the same, a physical rotation (movement) of −45° is not the same as a rotation of 315° (for example, the rotation of a person holding a broom resting on a dusty floor would leave visually different traces of swept regions on the floor).
In three-dimensional geometry, ""clockwise"" and ""anticlockwise"" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined in terms of an orientation, which is typically determined by a normal vector passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.
In navigation, bearings or azimuth are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angles are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45° corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315°.  
=== Equivalent angles ===
Angles that have the same measure (i.e., the same magnitude) are said to be equal or congruent. An angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle (e.g., all right angles are equal in measure).
Two angles that share terminal sides, but differ in size by an integer multiple of a turn, are called coterminal angles."|726c5dbde1e294d50000d6f84c3aadec|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
9|"Two angles that share terminal sides, but differ in size by an integer multiple of a turn, are called coterminal angles.
The reference angle (sometimes called related angle) for any angle θ in standard position is the positive acute angle between the terminal side of θ and the x-axis (positive or negative). Procedurally, the magnitude of the reference angle for a given angle may determined by taking the angle's magnitude modulo 1/2 turn, 180°, or π radians, then stopping if the angle is acute, otherwise taking the supplementary angle, 180° minus the reduced magnitude. For example, an angle of 30 degrees is already a reference angle, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180° − 150°). Angles of 210° and 510° correspond to a reference angle of 30 degrees as well (210° mod 180° = 30°, 510° mod 180° = 150° whose supplementary angle is 30°).  
=== Related quantities ===
For an angular unit, it is definitional that the angle addition postulate holds. Some quantities related to angles where the angle addition postulate does not hold include:  
The slope or gradient is equal to the tangent of the angle; a gradient is often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the slope of a line is approximately the measure in radians of its angle with the horizontal direction.
The spread between two lines is defined in rational geometry as the square of the sine of the angle between the lines. As the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines.
Although done rarely, one can report the direct results of trigonometric functions, such as the sine of the angle."|6bce5b6af8d9a9d96efd6e5dac04122d|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
10|The angle between a line and a curve (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the tangents at the point of intersection. Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:—amphicyrtic (Gr. ἀμφί, on both sides, κυρτός, convex) or cissoidal (Gr. κισσός, ivy), biconvex; xystroidal or sistroidal (Gr. ξυστρίς, a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; amphicoelic (Gr. κοίλη, a hollow) or angulus lunularis, biconcave.|c2d12980bb7b70f9fb723d2c11657fc9|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
11|The ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to bisect an angle (divide it into two angles of equal measure) using only a compass and straightedge but could only trisect certain angles. In 1837, Pierre Wantzel showed that this construction could not be performed for most angles.|ad5073e860989232fb6582a71474069b|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle

A hyperbolic angle is an argument of a hyperbolic function just as the circular angle is the argument of a circular function. The comparison can be visualized as the size of the openings of a hyperbolic sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument, the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by Leonhard Euler in Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite."|308bd91aaec58a26891bdaf9862dc5d4|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
14|"In geography, the location of any point on the Earth can be identified using a geographic coordinate system. This system specifies the latitude and longitude of any location in terms of angles subtended at the center of the Earth, using the equator and (usually) the Greenwich meridian as references.
In astronomy, a given point on the celestial sphere (that is, the apparent position of an astronomical object) can be identified using any of several astronomical coordinate systems, where the references vary according to the particular system. Astronomers measure the angular separation of two stars by imagining two lines through the center of the Earth, each intersecting one of the stars. The angle between those lines and the angular separation between the two stars can be measured.
In both geography and astronomy, a sighting direction can be specified in terms of a vertical angle such as altitude /elevation with respect to the horizon as well as the azimuth with respect to north.
Astronomers also measure objects' apparent size as an angular diameter. For example, the full moon has an angular diameter of approximately 0.5° when viewed from Earth. One could say, ""The Moon's diameter subtends an angle of half a degree."" The small-angle formula can convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.
Other astronomical approximations include:  
0.5° is the approximate diameter of the Sun and of the Moon as viewed from Earth.
1° is the approximate width of the little finger at arm's length.
10° is the approximate width of a closed fist at arm's length.
20° is the approximate width of a handspan at arm's length.These measurements depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough rule of thumb approximations only.
In astronomy, right ascension and declination are usually measured in angular units, expressed in terms of time, based on a 24-hour day."|2f1de260d65a67b696c5c7f6783d85d2|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle

18|"In geometry, a polygon () is a plane figure made up of line segments connected to form a closed polygonal chain.
The segments of a closed polygonal chain are called its edges or sides. The points where two edges meet are the polygon's vertices or corners. An n-gon is a polygon with n sides; for example, a triangle is a 3-gon.
A simple polygon is one which does not intersect itself. More precisely, the only allowed intersections among the line segments that make up the polygon are the shared endpoints of consecutive segments in the polygonal chain. A simple polygon is the boundary of a region of the plane that is called a solid polygon. The interior of a solid polygon is its body, also known as a polygonal region or polygonal area. In contexts where one is concerned only with simple and solid polygons, a polygon may refer only to a simple polygon or to a solid polygon.
A polygonal chain may cross over itself, creating star polygons and other self-intersecting polygons. Some sources also consider closed polygonal chains in Euclidean space to be a type of polygon (a skew polygon), even when the chain does not lie in a single plane.
A polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions. There are many more generalizations of polygons defined for different purposes."|2ec16ba8921c982745ebd9e8c7f9e8a0|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon

Convex: any line drawn through the polygon (and not tangent to an edge or corner) meets its boundary exactly twice. As a consequence, all its interior angles are less than 180°. Equivalently, any line segment with endpoints on the boundary passes through only interior points between its endpoints. This condition is true for polygons in any geometry, not just Euclidean.
Non-convex: a line may be found which meets its boundary more than twice. Equivalently, there exists a line segment between two boundary points that passes outside the polygon.
Simple: the boundary of the polygon does not cross itself. All convex polygons are simple.
Concave: Non-convex and simple. There is at least one interior angle greater than 180°.
Star-shaped: the whole interior is visible from at least one point, without crossing any edge. The polygon must be simple, and may be convex or concave. All convex polygons are star-shaped.
Self-intersecting: the boundary of the polygon crosses itself. The term complex is sometimes used in contrast to simple, but this usage risks confusion with the idea of a complex polygon as one which exists in the complex Hilbert plane consisting of two complex dimensions.
Star polygon: a polygon which self-intersects in a regular way. A polygon cannot be both a star and star-shaped.  
=== Equality and symmetry ===
Equiangular: all corner angles are equal.
Equilateral: all edges are of the same length.
Regular: both equilateral and equiangular.
Cyclic: all corners lie on a single circle, called the circumcircle.
Tangential: all sides are tangent to an inscribed circle.
Isogonal or vertex-transitive: all corners lie within the same symmetry orbit. The polygon is also cyclic and equiangular."|be6db54ae4e08e6a41aa444206daa594|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon
21|"Tangential: all sides are tangent to an inscribed circle.
Isogonal or vertex-transitive: all corners lie within the same symmetry orbit. The polygon is also cyclic and equiangular.
Isotoxal or edge-transitive: all sides lie within the same symmetry orbit. The polygon is also equilateral and tangential.The property of regularity may be defined in other ways: a polygon is regular if and only if it is both isogonal and isotoxal, or equivalently it is both cyclic and equilateral. A non-convex regular polygon is called a regular star polygon.  
=== Miscellaneous ===
Rectilinear: the polygon's sides meet at right angles, i.e. all its interior angles are 90 or 270 degrees.
Monotone with respect to a given line L: every line orthogonal to L intersects the polygon not more than twice."|2962aba2a8544331455c0f7be5a4c3a6|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon
22|"Euclidean geometry is assumed throughout.  
=== Angles ===
Any polygon has as many corners as it has sides. Each corner has several angles. The two most important ones are:  
Interior angle – The sum of the interior angles of a simple n-gon is (n − 2) × π radians or (n − 2) × 180 degrees. This is because any simple n-gon ( having n sides ) can be considered to be made up of (n − 2) triangles, each of which has an angle sum of π radians or 180 degrees. The measure of any interior angle of a convex regular n-gon is

{\displaystyle 180-{\tfrac {360}{n}}}
degrees. The interior angles of regular star polygons were first studied by Poinsot, in the same paper in which he describes the four regular star polyhedra: for a regular

degrees.
Exterior angle – The exterior angle is the supplementary angle to the interior angle. Tracing around a convex n-gon, the angle ""turned"" at a corner is the exterior or external angle. Tracing all the way around the polygon makes one full turn, so the sum of the exterior angles must be 360°. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an n-gon in general, the sum of the exterior angles (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple d of 360°, e.g. 720° for a pentagram and 0° for an angular ""eight"" or antiparallelogram, where d is the density or turning number of the polygon.

The signed area depends on the ordering of the vertices and of the orientation of the plane. Commonly, the positive orientation is defined by the (counterclockwise) rotation that maps the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis. If the vertices are ordered counterclockwise (that is, according to positive orientation), the signed area is positive; otherwise, it is negative. In either case, the area formula is correct in absolute value. This is commonly called the shoelace formula or surveyor's formula.The area A of a simple polygon can also be computed if the lengths of the sides, a1, a2, ..., an and the exterior angles, θ1, θ2, ..., θn are known, from:

The formula was described by Lopshits in 1963.If the polygon can be drawn on an equally spaced grid such that all its vertices are grid points, Pick's theorem gives a simple formula for the polygon's area based on the numbers of interior and boundary grid points: the former number plus one-half the latter number, minus 1.
In every polygon with perimeter p and area A , the isoperimetric inequality  
p  
2  
>
4
π
A  
{\displaystyle p^{2}>4\pi A}
holds.For any two simple polygons of equal area, the Bolyai–Gerwien theorem asserts that the first can be cut into polygonal pieces which can be reassembled to form the second polygon.
The lengths of the sides of a polygon do not in general determine its area. However, if the polygon is simple and cyclic then the sides do determine the area. Of all n-gons with given side lengths, the one with the largest area is cyclic. Of all n-gons with a given perimeter, the one with the largest area is regular (and therefore cyclic).

==== Self-intersecting ====
The area of a self-intersecting polygon can be defined in two different ways, giving different answers:  
Using the formulas for simple polygons, we allow that particular regions within the polygon may have their area multiplied by a factor which we call the density of the region. For example, the central convex pentagon in the center of a pentagram has density 2. The two triangular regions of a cross-quadrilateral (like a figure 8) have opposite-signed densities, and adding their areas together can give a total area of zero for the whole figure."|85da10af6596ef9711a092f10685d0a0|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon
26|"Considering the enclosed regions as point sets, we can find the area of the enclosed point set. This corresponds to the area of the plane covered by the polygon or to the area of one or more simple polygons having the same outline as the self-intersecting one. In the case of the cross-quadrilateral, it is treated as two simple triangles.

27|"The idea of a polygon has been generalized in various ways. Some of the more important include:  
A spherical polygon is a circuit of arcs of great circles (sides) and vertices on the surface of a sphere. It allows the digon, a polygon having only two sides and two corners, which is impossible in a flat plane. Spherical polygons play an important role in cartography (map making) and in Wythoff's construction of the uniform polyhedra.
A skew polygon does not lie in a flat plane, but zigzags in three (or more) dimensions. The Petrie polygons of the regular polytopes are well known examples.
An apeirogon is an infinite sequence of sides and angles, which is not closed but has no ends because it extends indefinitely in both directions.
A skew apeirogon is an infinite sequence of sides and angles that do not lie in a flat plane.
A polygon with holes is an area-connected or multiply-connected planar polygon with one external boundary and one or more interior boundaries (holes).
A complex polygon is a configuration analogous to an ordinary polygon, which exists in the complex plane of two real and two imaginary dimensions.
An abstract polygon is an algebraic partially ordered set representing the various elements (sides, vertices, etc.) and their connectivity. A real geometric polygon is said to be a realization of the associated abstract polygon. Depending on the mapping, all the generalizations described here can be realized.
A polyhedron is a three-dimensional solid bounded by flat polygonal faces, analogous to a polygon in two dimensions. The corresponding shapes in four or higher dimensions are called polytopes. (In other conventions, the words polyhedron and polytope are used in any dimension, with the distinction between the two that a polytope is necessarily bounded.)"|853b090d6918ddffaf638db21091aa90|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon
28|"The word polygon comes from Late Latin polygōnum (a noun), from Greek πολύγωνον (polygōnon/polugōnon), noun use of neuter of πολύγωνος (polygōnos/polugōnos, the masculine adjective), meaning ""many-angled"". Individual polygons are named (and sometimes classified) according to the number of sides, combining a Greek-derived numerical prefix with the suffix -gon, e.g. pentagon, dodecagon. The triangle, quadrilateral and nonagon are exceptions.
Beyond decagons (10-sided) and dodecagons (12-sided), mathematicians generally use numerical notation, for example 17-gon and 257-gon.Exceptions exist for side counts that are easily expressed in verbal form (e.g. 20 and 30), or are used by non-mathematicians. Some special polygons also have their own names; for example the regular star pentagon is also known as the pentagram.  
To construct the name of a polygon with more than 20 and fewer than 100 edges, combine the prefixes as follows. The ""kai"" term applies to 13-gons and higher and was used by Kepler, and advocated by John H. Conway for clarity of concatenated prefix numbers in the naming of quasiregular polyhedra, though not all sources use it."|26c0a7a0ae775215b15f3978cfbad809|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon
29|Polygons have been known since ancient times. The regular polygons were known to the ancient Greeks, with the pentagram, a non-convex regular polygon (star polygon), appearing as early as the 7th century B.C. on a krater by Aristophanes, found at Caere and now in the Capitoline Museum.The first known systematic study of non-convex polygons in general was made by Thomas Bradwardine in the 14th century.In 1952, Geoffrey Colin Shephard generalized the idea of polygons to the complex plane, where each real dimension is accompanied by an imaginary one, to create complex polygons.|f898b8dd59d62ab8e4923a89ccf70fa2|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon

Regular hexagons can occur when the cooling of lava forms areas of tightly packed columns of basalt, which may be seen at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, or at the Devil's Postpile in California.
In biology, the surface of the wax honeycomb made by bees is an array of hexagons, and the sides and base of each cell are also polygons."|90d18d24e5dc494cfa663e65f9de46cd|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon
31|"In computer graphics, a polygon is a primitive used in modelling and rendering. They are defined in a database, containing arrays of vertices (the coordinates of the geometrical vertices, as well as other attributes of the polygon, such as color, shading and texture), connectivity information, and materials.Any surface is modelled as a tessellation called polygon mesh. If a square mesh has n + 1 points (vertices) per side, there are n squared squares in the mesh, or 2n squared triangles since there are two triangles in a square. There are (n + 1)2 / 2(n2) vertices per triangle. Where n is large, this approaches one half. Or, each vertex inside the square mesh connects four edges (lines).
The imaging system calls up the structure of polygons needed for the scene to be created from the database. This is transferred to active memory and finally, to the display system (screen, TV monitors etc.) so that the scene can be viewed. During this process, the imaging system renders polygons in correct perspective ready for transmission of the processed data to the display system. Although polygons are two-dimensional, through the system computer they are placed in a visual scene in the correct three-dimensional orientation.
In computer graphics and computational geometry, it is often necessary to determine whether a given point

32|"In mathematics, an ellipse is a plane curve surrounding two focal points, such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant.

Ellipses are the closed type of conic section: a plane curve tracing the intersection of a cone with a plane (see figure). Ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections, parabolas and hyperbolas, both of which are open and unbounded. An angled cross section of a right circular cylinder is also an ellipse.
An ellipse may also be defined in terms of one focal point and a line outside the ellipse called the directrix: for all points on the ellipse, the ratio between the distance to the focus and the distance to the directrix is a constant. This constant ratio is the above-mentioned eccentricity:"|b3a91d54f63eeaa6931fcf501aabc665|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse
33|"Ellipses are common in physics, astronomy and engineering. For example, the orbit of each planet in the Solar System is approximately an ellipse with the Sun at one focus point (more precisely, the focus is the barycenter of the Sun–planet pair). The same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems of two astronomical bodies. The shapes of planets and stars are often well described by ellipsoids. A circle viewed from a side angle looks like an ellipse: that is, the ellipse is the image of a circle under parallel or perspective projection. The ellipse is also the simplest Lissajous figure formed when the horizontal and vertical motions are sinusoids with the same frequency: a similar effect leads to elliptical polarization of light in optics.

) of the ellipse. This property should not be confused with the definition of an ellipse using a directrix line below.
Using Dandelin spheres, one can prove that any section of a cone with a plane is an ellipse, assuming the plane does not contain the apex and has slope less than that of the lines on the cone."|c3d4de3a141f85f659b1eee382b1684f|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse
35|"=== Standard equation ===
The standard form of an ellipse in Cartesian coordinates assumes that the origin is the center of the ellipse, the x-axis is the major axis, and:  
For an arbitrary point  
(
x
,
y
)  
{\displaystyle (x,y)}
the distance to the focus  
(
c
,
0
)  
{\displaystyle (c,0)}
is  
(
x
−
c  
)  
2  
+  
y  
2  
{\textstyle {\sqrt {(x-c)^{2}+y^{2}}}}
and to the other focus  
(
x
+
c  
)  
2  
+  
y  
2  
{\textstyle {\sqrt {(x+c)^{2}+y^{2}}}}
. Hence the point  
(
x
,  
y
)  
{\displaystyle (x,\,y)}
is on the ellipse whenever:  
Removing the radicals by suitable squarings and using  
b  
2  
=  
a  
2  
−  
c  
2  
{\displaystyle b^{2}=a^{2}-c^{2}}
(see diagram) produces the standard equation of the ellipse:
or, solved for y:  
The width and height parameters  
a
,  
b  
{\displaystyle a,\;b}
are called the semi-major and semi-minor axes. The top and bottom points  
V  
3  
=
(
0
,  
b
)
,  
V  
4  
=
(
0
,  
−
b
)  
{\displaystyle V_{3}=(0,\,b),\;V_{4}=(0,\,-b)}
are the co-vertices. The distances from a point  
(
x
,  
y
)  
{\displaystyle (x,\,y)}
on the ellipse to the left and right foci are  
a
+
e
x  
{\displaystyle a+ex}
and  
a
−
e
x  
{\displaystyle a-ex}
.
It follows from the equation that the ellipse is symmetric with respect to the coordinate axes and hence with respect to the origin.  
=== Parameters ===  
==== Principal axes ====
Throughout this article, the semi-major and semi-minor axes are denoted  
a  
{\displaystyle a}
and  
b  
{\displaystyle b}
, respectively, i.e.  
a
≥
b
>
0  
.  
{\displaystyle a\geq b>0\ .}

a
<
b  
{\displaystyle a<b}
(and hence the ellipse would be taller than it is wide). This form can be converted to the standard form by transposing the variable names  
x

and  
y

and the parameter names

==== Linear eccentricity ====
This is the distance from the center to a focus:

{\displaystyle c={\sqrt {a^{2}-b^{2}}}}
.  
==== Eccentricity ====
The eccentricity can be expressed as:

b
.  
{\displaystyle a>b.}
An ellipse with equal axes (  
a

b  
{\displaystyle a=b}
) has zero eccentricity, and is a circle.  
==== Semi-latus rectum ====
The length of the chord through one focus, perpendicular to the major axis, is called the latus rectum. One half of it is the semi-latus rectum  
ℓ  
{\displaystyle \ell }
. A calculation shows:
The semi-latus rectum  
ℓ  
{\displaystyle \ell }
is equal to the radius of curvature at the vertices (see section curvature).  
=== Tangent ===
An arbitrary line  
g  
{\displaystyle g}
intersects an ellipse at 0, 1, or 2 points, respectively called an exterior line, tangent and secant. Through any point of an ellipse there is a unique tangent. The tangent at a point

In analytic geometry, the ellipse is defined as a quadric: the set of points

{\displaystyle B^{2}-4AC<0.}  
To distinguish the degenerate cases from the non-degenerate case, let ∆ be the determinant  
Then the ellipse is a non-degenerate real ellipse if and only if C∆ < 0. If C∆ > 0, we have an imaginary ellipse, and if ∆ = 0, we have a point ellipse.: 63 The general equation's coefficients can be obtained from known semi-major axis

(the angle from the positive horizontal axis to the ellipse's major axis) using the formulae:  
These expressions can be derived from the canonical equation  
by a Euclidean transformation of the coordinates

Conversely, the canonical form parameters can be obtained from the general-form coefficients by the equations:

43|"=== Polar form relative to center ===
In polar coordinates, with the origin at the center of the ellipse and with the angular coordinate  
θ  
{\displaystyle \theta }
measured from the major axis, the ellipse's equation is: 75
where  
e  
{\displaystyle e}
is the eccentricity, not Euler's number.  
=== Polar form relative to focus ===
If instead we use polar coordinates with the origin at one focus, with the angular coordinate  
θ
=
0  
{\displaystyle \theta =0}
still measured from the major axis, the ellipse's equation is  
where the sign in the denominator is negative if the reference direction  
θ
=
0  
{\displaystyle \theta =0}
points towards the center (as illustrated on the right), and positive if that direction points away from the center.
In the slightly more general case of an ellipse with one focus at the origin and the other focus at angular coordinate  
ϕ

A circle has the following property:  
The midpoints of parallel chords lie on a diameter.An affine transformation preserves parallelism and midpoints of line segments, so this property is true for any ellipse. (Note that the parallel chords and the diameter are no longer orthogonal.)

52|"Ellipses appear in descriptive geometry as images (parallel or central projection) of circles. There exist various tools to draw an ellipse. Computers provide the fastest and most accurate method for drawing an ellipse. However, technical tools (ellipsographs) to draw an ellipse without a computer exist. The principle of ellipsographs were known to Greek mathematicians such as Archimedes and Proklos.
If there is no ellipsograph available, one can draw an ellipse using an approximation by the four osculating circles at the vertices.
For any method described below, knowledge of the axes and the semi-axes is necessary (or equivalently: the foci and the semi-major axis). If this presumption is not fulfilled one has to know at least two conjugate diameters. With help of Rytz's construction the axes and semi-axes can be retrieved.

Draw a line through the center, which intersects the two circles at point

Draw a line through  
A  
{\displaystyle A}
that is parallel to the minor axis and a line through  
B

=== Pins-and-string method ===
The characterization of an ellipse as the locus of points so that sum of the distances to the foci is constant leads to a method of drawing one using two drawing pins, a length of string, and a pencil. In this method, pins are pushed into the paper at two points, which become the ellipse's foci. A string is tied at each end to the two pins; its length after tying is  
2
a  
{\displaystyle 2a}
. The tip of the pencil then traces an ellipse if it is moved while keeping the string taut. Using two pegs and a rope, gardeners use this procedure to outline an elliptical flower bed—thus it is called the gardener's ellipse.
A similar method for drawing confocal ellipses with a closed string is due to the Irish bishop Charles Graves.  
=== Paper strip methods ===
The two following methods rely on the parametric representation (see § Standard parametric representation, above):  
This representation can be modeled technically by two simple methods. In both cases center, the axes and semi axes  
a
,  
b  
{\displaystyle a,\,b}
have to be known.  
Method 1The first method starts with  
a strip of paper of length  
a
+
b  
{\displaystyle a+b}
.The point, where the semi axes meet is marked by  
P  
{\displaystyle P}
. If the strip slides with both ends on the axes of the desired ellipse, then point  
P  
{\displaystyle P}
traces the ellipse. For the proof one shows that point  
P  
{\displaystyle P}
has the parametric representation  
(
a
cos
⁡
t
,  
b
sin
⁡
t
)  
{\displaystyle (a\cos t,\,b\sin t)}
, where parameter  
t  
{\displaystyle t}
is the angle of the slope of the paper strip.
A technical realization of the motion of the paper strip can be achieved by a Tusi couple (see animation). The device is able to draw any ellipse with a fixed sum

54|"A technical realization of the motion of the paper strip can be achieved by a Tusi couple (see animation). The device is able to draw any ellipse with a fixed sum  
a
+
b  
{\displaystyle a+b}
, which is the radius of the large circle. This restriction may be a disadvantage in real life. More flexible is the second paper strip method.  
A variation of the paper strip method 1 uses the observation that the midpoint  
N  
{\displaystyle N}
of the paper strip is moving on the circle with center  
M  
{\displaystyle M}
(of the ellipse) and radius  
a
+
b  
2  
{\displaystyle {\tfrac {a+b}{2}}}
. Hence, the paperstrip can be cut at point  
N  
{\displaystyle N}
into halves, connected again by a joint at  
N  
{\displaystyle N}
and the sliding end  
K  
{\displaystyle K}
fixed at the center  
M  
{\displaystyle M}
(see diagram). After this operation the movement of the unchanged half of the paperstrip is unchanged. This variation requires only one sliding shoe.  
Method 2
The second method starts with  
a strip of paper of length  
a  
{\displaystyle a}
.One marks the point, which divides the strip into two substrips of length  
b  
{\displaystyle b}
and  
a
−
b  
{\displaystyle a-b}
. The strip is positioned onto the axes as described in the diagram. Then the free end of the strip traces an ellipse, while the strip is moved. For the proof, one recognizes that the tracing point can be described parametrically by  
(
a
cos
⁡
t
,  
b
sin
⁡
t
)  
{\displaystyle (a\cos t,\,b\sin t)}
, where parameter  
t  
{\displaystyle t}
is the angle of slope of the paper strip.
This method is the base for several ellipsographs (see section below).
Similar to the variation of the paper strip method 1 a variation of the paper strip method 2 can be established (see diagram) by cutting the part between the axes into halves.  
Most ellipsograph drafting instruments are based on the second paperstrip method.

The centers for the remaining vertices are found by symmetry.
With help of a French curve one draws a curve, which has smooth contact to the osculating circles.

Such a relation between points and lines generated by a conic is called pole-polar relation or polarity. The pole is the point; the polar the line.
By calculation one can confirm the following properties of the pole-polar relation of the ellipse:  
For a point (pole) on the ellipse, the polar is the tangent at this point (see diagram:

p

{\displaystyle P_{1},\,p_{1}}
).
For a pole

{\displaystyle \pi b^{2}}

a

b  
{\displaystyle a/b}

So far we have dealt with erect ellipses, whose major and minor axes are parallel to the  
x

which is in general not an elementary function.
The circumference of the ellipse may be evaluated in terms of  
E

Srinivasa Ramanujan gave two close approximations for the circumference in §16 of ""Modular Equations and Approximations to  
π

respectively.  
=== Arc length ===  
More generally, the arc length of a portion of the circumference, as a function of the angle subtended (or x coordinates of any two points on the upper half of the ellipse), is given by an incomplete elliptic integral. The upper half of an ellipse is parameterized by  
Then the arc length  
s

==== Elliptical reflectors and acoustics ====  
If the water's surface is disturbed at one focus of an elliptical water tank, the circular waves of that disturbance, after reflecting off the walls, converge simultaneously to a single point: the second focus. This is a consequence of the total travel length being the same along any wall-bouncing path between the two foci.
Similarly, if a light source is placed at one focus of an elliptic mirror, all light rays on the plane of the ellipse are reflected to the second focus. Since no other smooth curve has such a property, it can be used as an alternative definition of an ellipse. (In the special case of a circle with a source at its center all light would be reflected back to the center.) If the ellipse is rotated along its major axis to produce an ellipsoidal mirror (specifically, a prolate spheroid), this property holds for all rays out of the source. Alternatively, a cylindrical mirror with elliptical cross-section can be used to focus light from a linear fluorescent lamp along a line of the paper; such mirrors are used in some document scanners."|3637bc6e7d29e840e3d3bb195e09232e|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse
71|"Sound waves are reflected in a similar way, so in a large elliptical room a person standing at one focus can hear a person standing at the other focus remarkably well. The effect is even more evident under a vaulted roof shaped as a section of a prolate spheroid. Such a room is called a whisper chamber. The same effect can be demonstrated with two reflectors shaped like the end caps of such a spheroid, placed facing each other at the proper distance. Examples are the National Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol (where John Quincy Adams is said to have used this property for eavesdropping on political matters); the Mormon Tabernacle at Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah; at an exhibit on sound at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago; in front of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign Foellinger Auditorium; and also at a side chamber of the Palace of Charles V, in the Alhambra.  
==== Planetary orbits ====  
In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun [approximately] at one focus, in his first law of planetary motion. Later, Isaac Newton explained this as a corollary of his law of universal gravitation.
More generally, in the gravitational two-body problem, if the two bodies are bound to each other (that is, the total energy is negative), their orbits are similar ellipses with the common barycenter being one of the foci of each ellipse. The other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance. The orbit of either body in the reference frame of the other is also an ellipse, with the other body at the same focus."|b2789972a438a25b7d99973a38fddc6c|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse
72|"Keplerian elliptical orbits are the result of any radially directed attraction force whose strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Thus, in principle, the motion of two oppositely charged particles in empty space would also be an ellipse. (However, this conclusion ignores losses due to electromagnetic radiation and quantum effects, which become significant when the particles are moving at high speed.)
For elliptical orbits, useful relations involving the eccentricity  
e  
{\displaystyle e}
are:  
where  
r  
a  
{\displaystyle r_{a}}
is the radius at apoapsis (the farthest distance)  
r  
p  
{\displaystyle r_{p}}
is the radius at periapsis (the closest distance)  
a  
{\displaystyle a}
is the length of the semi-major axisAlso, in terms of  
r  
a  
{\displaystyle r_{a}}
and  
r  
p  
{\displaystyle r_{p}}
, the semi-major axis  
a  
{\displaystyle a}
is their arithmetic mean, the semi-minor axis  
b  
{\displaystyle b}
is their geometric mean, and the semi-latus rectum  
ℓ  
{\displaystyle \ell }
is their harmonic mean. In other words,  
==== Harmonic oscillators ====
The general solution for a harmonic oscillator in two or more dimensions is also an ellipse. Such is the case, for instance, of a long pendulum that is free to move in two dimensions; of a mass attached to a fixed point by a perfectly elastic spring; or of any object that moves under influence of an attractive force that is directly proportional to its distance from a fixed attractor. Unlike Keplerian orbits, however, these ""harmonic orbits"" have the center of attraction at the geometric center of the ellipse, and have fairly simple equations of motion.  
==== Phase visualization ====
In electronics, the relative phase of two sinusoidal signals can be compared by feeding them to the vertical and horizontal inputs of an oscilloscope. If the Lissajous figure display is an ellipse, rather than a straight line, the two signals are out of phase.  
==== Elliptical gears ===="|e97ed7fe05696ac03cd9873d0d738fac|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse
73|"==== Elliptical gears ====
Two non-circular gears with the same elliptical outline, each pivoting around one focus and positioned at the proper angle, turn smoothly while maintaining contact at all times. Alternatively, they can be connected by a link chain or timing belt, or in the case of a bicycle the main chainring may be elliptical, or an ovoid similar to an ellipse in form. Such elliptical gears may be used in mechanical equipment to produce variable angular speed or torque from a constant rotation of the driving axle, or in the case of a bicycle to allow a varying crank rotation speed with inversely varying mechanical advantage.
Elliptical bicycle gears make it easier for the chain to slide off the cog when changing gears.An example gear application would be a device that winds thread onto a conical bobbin on a spinning machine. The bobbin would need to wind faster when the thread is near the apex than when it is near the base.  
==== Optics ====
In a material that is optically anisotropic (birefringent), the refractive index depends on the direction of the light. The dependency can be described by an index ellipsoid. (If the material is optically isotropic, this ellipsoid is a sphere.)
In lamp-pumped solid-state lasers, elliptical cylinder-shaped reflectors have been used to direct light from the pump lamp (coaxial with one ellipse focal axis) to the active medium rod (coaxial with the second focal axis).
In laser-plasma produced EUV light sources used in microchip lithography, EUV light is generated by plasma positioned in the primary focus of an ellipsoid mirror and is collected in the secondary focus at the input of the lithography machine.

74|"=== Statistics and finance ===
In statistics, a bivariate random vector  
(
X
,
Y
)  
{\displaystyle (X,Y)}
is jointly elliptically distributed if its iso-density contours—loci of equal values of the density function—are ellipses. The concept extends to an arbitrary number of elements of the random vector, in which case in general the iso-density contours are ellipsoids. A special case is the multivariate normal distribution. The elliptical distributions are important in finance because if rates of return on assets are jointly elliptically distributed then all portfolios can be characterized completely by their mean and variance—that is, any two portfolios with identical mean and variance of portfolio return have identical distributions of portfolio return.  
=== Computer graphics ===
Drawing an ellipse as a graphics primitive is common in standard display libraries, such as the MacIntosh QuickDraw API, and Direct2D on Windows. Jack Bresenham at IBM is most famous for the invention of 2D drawing primitives, including line and circle drawing, using only fast integer operations such as addition and branch on carry bit. M. L. V. Pitteway extended Bresenham's algorithm for lines to conics in 1967. Another efficient generalization to draw ellipses was invented in 1984 by Jerry Van Aken.In 1970 Danny Cohen presented at the ""Computer Graphics 1970"" conference in England a linear algorithm for drawing ellipses and circles. In 1971, L. B. Smith published similar algorithms for all conic sections and proved them to have good properties. These algorithms need only a few multiplications and additions to calculate each vector.
It is beneficial to use a parametric formulation in computer graphics because the density of points is greatest where there is the most curvature. Thus, the change in slope between each successive point is small, reducing the apparent ""jaggedness"" of the approximation.  
Drawing with Bézier paths"|01dccb5454d63e7b42c3146cb45dcbf2|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse
75|"Drawing with Bézier paths
Composite Bézier curves may also be used to draw an ellipse to sufficient accuracy, since any ellipse may be construed as an affine transformation of a circle. The spline methods used to draw a circle may be used to draw an ellipse, since the constituent Bézier curves behave appropriately under such transformations.  
=== Optimization theory ===
It is sometimes useful to find the minimum bounding ellipse on a set of points. The ellipsoid method is quite useful for solving this problem."|4a5637a84ea4e6b3a2e0c931cf275193|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse
